### Royalty-free Music

Because Shifted Dimension is a free project, and my goal is to not spend a single penny on the game unless I have to (hosting fees, etc) there are a lot of songs from various artists within the public/royalty free domain I am using.

I will add each song in a list below, where it's used, it's title, it's artist, and a link to where you can listen to/download it from.

#### Main Menu Music

When you fire up the game and are in the main menu, it will choose a random song to play once. These songs may also appear in other sections of the game, but their main focus is the main menu.

 - Ross Bugden: Welcome to Chaos - [Listen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5w5VX4tAD4)
 - Virtual Riot: Energy Drink - [Listen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IOVkstxkdE)

### Other assets

 - Alex Perrault was created using [MakeHuman](http://www.makehuman.org), a free, open-source application for creating anatomically correct human meshes with a competent rig.
 - The EARTH building was created using standard, stock assets within the Unreal Engine.
