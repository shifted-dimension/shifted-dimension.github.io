title: Why Shifted Dimension was not released yesterday
---
Well, it appears that I let everyone down the other day. Whoops. Well, I'll explain why I couldn't get the build out. Those of you on Rhobar's Chat Room would know why; but for those of you who do not, let me explain.

So, I had finished building the EARTH building and working on some finishing touches (mainly some major bugfixes and moving the main menu into EARTH) and was ready to package the game.

So I went to package, and when it was done I realized I forgot to save my work. OOPS. So, I resaved and tried again.

Then, when it was done I had gotten a fatal error upon running the game. It just said "Fatal error" and nothing else.

Then I tried with a different build config.

Turns out it forgot to generate the .uproject file (a JSON-formatted Unreal Project file that tells the game where it's assets are and what it is) and it wasn't like I was able to generate that myself...

BUT, I tried something. I tried to put the .uproject file that was in the source code into the folder where the missing .uproject was and named it accordingly. THAT, was an EPIC fail, because although the game started I just got a black screen.

It was close to supper-time, and I was getting frustrated. So, I gave up for the night. Be happy I did because I was about ready to throw my development PC out the window and destroy just about everything else in the room.

Hopefully tonight I can get it working, and if I do, expect a release tonight.



OH, While you're still here...

Want a sneak-peak of the next round of development?

Well, I'll be adding driveable cars, and some expansions to the EARTH building. Hope you're excited!
